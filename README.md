# Complex Algorithms
This repository contains completed assignments from the 2016 Complex Algorithms &amp; Datastructures course provided by the University of San Diego. These assignments were completed for fun, and have no connection to the University itself. 

The assignments consist of the following elements: 
- Flows in Networks
    - **Evacuation Assignment**: Apply a maximum flow algorithm in a network to determine the fastest time in which people can be evacuated from a given city.
    - **Airline Crew**: Apply a flow algorithm for matching in a bipartite graph to assign airline crews to flights in the most efficient way.
    - **Stock Charts**: Apply a flow algorithm to find the minimum Path Cover in a DAG to compute the maximum number of stock charts that do not intersect. 
- Linear Programming
  - **Energy Values**: Apply Gaussian elimination to calculate the amount of nutrients that each ingredient in a given ingredient list has.
  - **Diet**: Implement an algorithm for solving linear programming and apply it to determine the optimal diet. 
- NP-Completeness
    - **GSM Network**: Encoding to SAT the 3-coloring problem to determine if a GSM network could work.
    - **Apartment Cleaning**: Encoding to SAT the Hamiltonian Path problem to find a a clever way to clean an apartment.
- Coping with NP-completeness
    - **Integrated Circuit Design**: Solving 2-SAT by constructing a directed implications graph and looking for strongly connected components to design as part of an integrated circuit.
    - **Fun Party**: Computing max independent set of a tree to plan a fun party. 
- Streaming Algorithms
    - **Nice vs Naughty**: Helping Santa Claus out by implementing the count sketch algorithm to determine if a kid was nice or naughty.
