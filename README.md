# Complex-Algorithms
This repository contains completed assignments from the Complex Algorithms &amp; Datastructures course provided by the University of San Diego. These assignments were completed for fun, and have no connection to the University itself. 

The following assignments have been completed: 
- Flows in Networks
    - **Evacuation Assignment**: Apply a maximum flow algorithm in a network to determine the fastest time in which people can be evacuated from a given city.
    - **Airline Crew**: Apply a flow algorithm for matching in a bipartite graph to assign airline crews to flights in the most efficient way.
    - **Stock Charts**: Apply a flow algorithm to find the minimum Path Cover in a DAG to compute the maximum number of stock charts that do not intersect. 
- Linear Programming
  - **Energy Values**: Apply Gaussian elimination to calculate the amount of nutrients that each ingredient in a given ingredient list has.
  - **Diet**: Apply Gaussian elimination to perform a brute force linear programming approach to...
- NP-Completeness
- Coping with NP-completeness
- Streaming Algorithms
